The N.B.A. (National Basketball Association) has a season where 30 teams of 15 athletes compete throughout 82 regular-season 
games. Every player doesn't get to play all 82 games and deciding who plays in which regulation game can be one of the 
toughest decisions to make when the game is close and time is running out.

I set out to try and solve this problem by using a data set that consisted of most players from 1950-2017 and a goal in 
mind of using this data to predict if it was possible to know how much of a season an athlete should play given prior 
stats of similar athletes. 

#### The Idea 💡
What I came up with was a toy model that tells us what percentage of a season a player should play dependent on 𝟕 features:

- Blocks (BLK) - "A block occurs when an offensive player attempts a shot, and the defense player tips the ball, blocking their chance to score."
- Steals (STL) - "Number of times a defensive player or team takes the ball from a player on offense, causing a turnover."
- Age - The player's age during the season.
- Assists (AST) - "The number of assists -- passes that lead directly to a made basket -- by a player."
- Total Rebounds (TRB) - The total amount of rebounds made by the player during the entire season.
- Points (PTS) - "The number of points scored"
- Position (Pos) - What position they played throughout the season.

I use the newly made statistic and compare it to the number of games the player played. 

When my model predicted more games than seen, I concluded that the player had been underutilized during the season. 

When it predicted fewer games than seen, I concluded my model determined the player to be over utilized. The player 
may have played more games than supposed too dependent on the 𝟕 features and compared across ~26,000 observations.

#### Process
The data for my project consisted of 24,691 observations and 64 features. When I was done cleaning the data, I ended up with 24,691 observations, seven features, and a mean baseline of 63.4%. I wanted to find out if it was possible to accurately predict what percentage of a season an NBA player should play based on prior stats of similar athletes. It came as no surprise that points were the most significant indicator of season gameplay when looking at the permutation importance seen below. Permutation importance served as a quick way to understand what features have the most significant effect on our predictions.

Looking below is a partial dependency plot that shows the marginal effect of "PTS" (Points) had on the predicted outcome of our model. The PDP plot is great for understanding if the target and feature are linear,  monotonic, or more complex. We can see there is a monotonic relationship between "PTS" and our target "season_pct_played". We can see the most significant marginal increase when going from 0-99 points scored in a season.

The target of my model was "season_pct_played". I divided the number of games played by the total amount of season games to determine what percent of the season was played by a player in my data set. My model used an [XGBRegressor](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python/python_api.html) model that allowed me to achieve an R^2 score of ~0.81 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of ~0.14. With these two scores, we can tell the model explains about 81%(R^2) of the variance seen in the data, and the RMSE tells us how far our predictions deviate from the actual values, about 14%.

#### Insight

The inherent usefulness of my model comes from the fact that a Coach can gain better insight into how a player will perform before the season starts or during the season. A team can better understand the role a traded player will have during the season and what to expect when bringing them onto the team. By taking the statistic predicted by the model and comparing it with the actual results, a Coach can determine which players should potentially be played more or less. Looking to the right, we can see an interaction of two features (Age and Points(PTS)). As long as your ability to score points in regulation games, your age has little to no impact on your chances of playing during the season.

Taking a closer look at an individual prediction, we can determine what features played the most prominent role when deciding what percent of the season should be played. For example, Hilton Armstrong was a Center that played ~79% of the NBA season during the year he played.
