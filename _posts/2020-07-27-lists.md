# Lets Start by Making Lists
click the underlined terms to read more about them

Python lists are extremely powerful when used correctly for storing information of the same or different data types. Lists are always created using square brackets ([]) and each element in a list is mutable. The best way to learn how to use a list is to practice! Feel free to grab the code notebook at the bottom and follow along.

```python
# Typing our list out
list1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
print(list1)

# Creating a list by iterating through a range of numbers and appending each element to the empty list.
rng = 5 
list2 = [] 
for x in range(rng): 
list2.append(x) 
print(list2)

# Using the range() function and list comprehension to make a list list3 = [x for x in range(rng)]
print(list3)

# Strings can be lists
a = "konnichiwa"
print(list(a))

# Output
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4] 
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4] 
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
['k', 'o', 'n', 'n', 'i', 'c', 'h', 'i', 'w', 'a']
```

## Lists can store a mixture of data types including:

- [Integers]("https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/functions.html#int") ```python [1,2,3,4,5] ```
- [Floats]("https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/functions.html#float") ```python [1.1, 2.22, 3.333, 4.4444, 5.55555] ```
- [Strings]("https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/functions.html#func-str") ```python [“Hi”, “How”, “Are”, “You”] ```
- [Lists]("https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-list") ```python [[1,2], [3,4], [5,6]] ```
- [Dictionaries]("https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#func-dict") ```python [{“one”, 1}, {“two”, 2}, {“three”: 3}] ```
- [Variables]("https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#vars") ```python a,b,c = 1,2,3 ---> list1 = [a,b,c] ```
- A mixture of Data Types [1, “a”, 2.22, {“one”:1}, [9,8,7]]

Every time you make a list in python it automatically comes with built-in methods for using it, there are some built-in functions in the python standard library that work great with lists too.
