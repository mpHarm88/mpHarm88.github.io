Cannabis has been used for thousands of years medicinally and spiritually to provide relief for its patients. Now, as cannabis legalization is slowly sweeping over the country, and a new slew of potential users turn to the green plant for a solution to their ailments that may not have been alleviated by pharmaceuticals, we have to ask ourselves. 

How do we prescribe a particular strain to a patient that will fulfill the patients needs the first time.

That is what I intend to find out using Natural Language Processing and a dataset composed of over 2,500 different strains, descriptions, ailments, types, flavors, and effects. 

What I created was a model that will return the most relevant strains based on what the patient inputs.

### For Example: 
- A user would input their desired effects and ailments to treat, and the model would return the five closest strains that matched their input. 
- The model would also return a probability value of what type of strain they were looking for (Hybrid, Sativa, Indica, Hybrid-Indica, Hybrid-Sativa)
- The model would also return the top 3 Flavors, Effects, and Ailments associated with the user's input. 


### Visuals

Here are some of the most common flavors, effects, and ailments associated with cannabis found in the data. The visuals use something called word embeddings to associate a number with each word. I used SpaCy's pre-trained model to apply the appropriate weights to help accurately map the distances each word was from one another. 

The visuals showed a common association of words that we would expect to see — seeing these associations indicate that the model is associating the right words together correctly.
