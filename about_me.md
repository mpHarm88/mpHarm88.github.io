Hello,

Thank you so much for stopping by my page. My name is Mikio Harman, and I'm a Data Scientist in Seattle, WA. I'm currently enrolled at Lambda School's Data Science program and should be graduating in June 2020. If you would like to inquire about a potential opportunity, please feel free to send me an email or contact me on twitter. 

I think DataScience is one of the most exciting and challenging jobs in the world. I thoroughly enjoy discovering new intuitions when it comes to data. Every data set has a story, and I'm just one person that can help you tell it. 

Enjoy your stay and feel free to provide any feedback about my posts.
